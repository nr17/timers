# Timers

This repository contains a simple timer manager implementation.

## Running the test

A small test program is provided in `scheme1/orderedList_test.cpp`. Build and
run it using the `test` target of the Makefile:

```bash
cd scheme1
make test
```

The program will build and automatically execute, exiting with status 0 if the
assertions pass.
